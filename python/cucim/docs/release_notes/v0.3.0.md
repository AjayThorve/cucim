# Version 0.3.0 (February 16, 2021)

## What's new?

- A new name and namespace (currently `cuClaraImage` and `cucim`) will be picked in `v0.4.0` once it's finalized
- Add metadata and associated images for Philips TIFF Format
  - Support Philips TIFF associated image from XML metadata
- Expose metadata of the image as JSON
  - `raw_metadata` property returns the image description of the first IFD in the TIFF image
  - `resolution_dim_start` property of `CuImage` is removed
  - `physical_pixel_size` property is renamed to `spacing`
  - `ndim`/`origin`/`direction`/`coord_sys`/`spacing_units` properties are added
  - Please see `Basic Usage` (/notebooks/Basic_Usage.html#see-metadata) notebook to know how to access metadata.
- Support reading out of boundary region
  - `read_region()` method now accepts a region that is out of the image boundary
  - `size` parameter accepts values that are up to the size of the highest-resolution image
  - The out of the boundary area would be filled with the white color
- Showcase the interoperability with DALI
  - Please see `Working with DALI` (/notebooks/Working_with_DALI.html) notebook

## Fixes/Improvements

- Fix wrong parameter interpretation (`size` in `read_region()` method). Now only `location` is level-0 based coordinates (using the level-0 reference frame). `size` is output image size. (Thanks `@Behrooz Hashemian`!)
- Static link with cufile when [libcufile.a is available](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQ_T805dlTcDU9bGW32E2ak5InX8iUcNI7Tq_lXAtLc/edit?ts=5f90bc5f) -- Implemented but disabled for now
- Fix a memory leak for cuslide::tiff::TIFF object (248 bytes) in CuImage class.
- Fix incorrect method visibility in a plugin file (.so)
- Replace malloc with better allocator for small-sized memory
  - Use a custom allocator(pmr) for metadata data
- Copy data using `std::vector::insert()` instead of `std::vector::push_back()`
  - Small improvement (when opening TIFF file), but benchmark result showed that time for assigning 50000 tile offset/size (uint64_t) is reduced from 118 us to 8 us
- Parameterize input library/image for testing
- Update test input path
  - Add test data under `test_data/private` : See `test_data/README.md` file.
- Setup development environment with VSCode (in addition to CLion)
- Use a VSCode plugin for local test execution
  - Now it uses `matepek.vscode-catch2-test-adapter` extension
    - <https://github.com/matepek/vscode-catch2-test-adapter/blob/master/documents/configuration/test.advancedExecutables.md>
- Prevent relative path problem of .so with no DT_SONAME
- Refactoring
  - Add Development environment for VSCode
    - Update run script
    - Add settings for VSCode
  - Refactor CMakeLists.txt
    - Add definition `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` to all sub directories
    - Compile multiple architectures for CUDA Kernels
  - Parameterize input files for tests
    - Add `test_data` folder for test data
    - plugin folder is from `CUCIM_TEST_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable now (with static plugin name (cucim.kit.cuslide@0.3.0.so))
  - Move cucim_malloc() to memory_manager.cu

## Limitations

- Some metadata (`origin`/`direction`/`coord_sys`/`spacing`/`spacing_units`) doesn't have correct values for now.
