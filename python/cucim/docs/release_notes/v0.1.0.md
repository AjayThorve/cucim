# Version 0.1.0 (October 28, 2020)

## What are provided in the package?

- API Documents
- C++ & Python library packages
- Example project (using CMake. For C++)
- Example code in a Jupyter notebook (with a docker image)

## Features

For v1, we have a limited feature focusing on generic tiled/multi-resolution TIFF file format (Jpeg-compressed RGB image).

- Loading part of the image using read_region() API
- Saving the loaded image in .ppm format (loadable by 'eog' viewer in Ubuntu or PIL library in Python)

## Limitations

- The following feature is not implemented yet
  - Accessing image data through container() API (in C++) or as a numpy array (using `__array_interface__` in Python)
- Errors are not handled properly yet (e.g., loading non-existing file would cause a crash)
- Some metadata (e.g., physical size) is hard-coded for now
- C++ library is forced to set `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI` to 0 due to [Dual ABI](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html) problem
  - Will package CXX11 ABI library separately later
