# Version 0.18.2 (March 29, 2021)

## What's new?

- Use the white background only for Philips TIFF file.
  - Generic TIFF file would have the black background by default.

## Fixes

- Fix upside-downed image for TIFF file if the image is not RGB & tiled image with JPEG/Deflate-compressed tiles.
  - Use slow path if the image is not RGB & tiled image with JPEG/Deflate-compressed tiles.
    - Show an error message if the out-of-boundary cases are requested with the slow path.
    - `ValueError: Cannot handle the out-of-boundary cases for a non-RGB image or a non-Jpeg/Deflate-compressed image.`
